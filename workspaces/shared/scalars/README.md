# GQL Custom Scalars

This package contains a set of useful scalars used in this project. There are
two appraoches used to encode scalars: "string scalars" and "tagged scalars".

# String Scalars

These are scalars that are fundamentally strings with special validations
attached to them, for example currency strings. These have meaning all by
themselves and don't strictly need to be decoded before they can be used.
